## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- js - flip card and button control

### What I learned

My first attempt at a challenge with JavaScript so lots of learning there.

Despite having done several Newbie challenges I am just starting to feel comfy with centering elements...disappointed that it took this long. Likely more work on this via more work and focus.

### Continued development

More JS for sure.
